# Covid19-analysis

**COVID-19 Data Analysis Project**

**Overview:**
This project aims to analyze COVID-19 data to understand the spread of the virus across different countries and identify factors influencing infection rates. The analysis involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical analysis, and data visualization.

**Dataset:**
The COVID-19 dataset used in this analysis is sourced from the Johns Hopkins University's Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE). The dataset provides daily counts of confirmed COVID-19 cases worldwide, aggregated at the country level.

**Project Structure:**
1. **Data Gathering:** The COVID-19 dataset is obtained from the JHU CSSE GitHub repository using the provided URL.
2. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** Data cleaning involves removing unnecessary columns and aggregating data at the country level to prepare it for analysis.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** EDA is performed to visualize trends in COVID-19 cases over time and identify geographical patterns.
4. **Statistical Analysis:** Statistical techniques are applied to identify correlations between COVID-19 cases and various socio-economic factors.
5. **Data Visualization:** The findings of the analysis are presented using visualizations such as line plots, heatmaps, and correlation matrices.
6. **Interpretation and Insights:** The results of the analysis are interpreted to derive insights into the factors influencing the spread of COVID-19 and inform decision-making.
7. **Documentation and Reporting:** A comprehensive report is created summarizing the analysis process, findings, and conclusions.
8. **Deployment (Optional):** The analysis can be deployed as a web application or interactive dashboard for further exploration.

**Instructions:**
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.
3. Run the Python script `covid_data_analysis.py` to execute the analysis.
4. View the generated visualizations and insights in the output.
5. Refer to the detailed documentation provided in the report for a deeper understanding of the analysis.

**Dependencies:**
- pandas
- matplotlib
